Facets
======

This is an experimental project to play with a notion that being able to dynamically add and remove 
types from an object would be helpful.

Consider a person who has a gender, birth date and height among other attributes; this person can walk,
run and jump among their various behaviours. Now consider this person joining a football team and gains
both attributes and behaviours related to that team.

Given the fact that many things in the real world exhibit a similar ability to change I want to see
whether this might produce a useful programming paradigm.
